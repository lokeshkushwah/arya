* Bundled themes: add customizer option to show/hide author bio, replace JS based smooth scroll with CSS (see related dev note) and fix Instagram embed CSS.

* Embeds: remove CollegeHumor oEmbed provider as the service doesnâ€™t exist anymore.
* External libraries: update sodium_compat.
* Site health: allow the remind interval for the admin email verification to be filtered.
* Uploads: avoid thumbnails overwriting other uploads when filename matches, and exclude PNG images from scaling after upload.
